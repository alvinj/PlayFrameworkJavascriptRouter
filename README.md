## A Play Framework Javascript Router Example

This project is a Play Framework Javascript Router example.
It shows how to use the Play Javascript Router in a simple
user "sign up" form.

### How the application works

It's important to note that the application isn't intended to
completely work. What it does is display a "sign up" form.
Then, when you put some data in the "Email" field and leave
that field (causing a Javascript 'blur' event), the Javascript
in the signup form web page calls the doesEmailAddressExist
function in the Application controller using AJAX. That's all
it's intended to demonstrate.

I didn't create this example, but I got it working by modifying this
more-complicated example:

My purpose is just to show a simple Javascript Routing example, while
that example attempts to show more things.
